                 <p>Per the dictionary, the word'supreme' is used to describe something “very great or intense.” That seems like the perfect word to describe a giant pizza loaded up with both meats and vegetables!
                       Then again, 'supreme' is also defined as “involving death,” but that definition doesn't seem like it fits as well in this particular scenario.
                       A supreme pizza should be awe-inspiring enough to rule over both the carnivores and the omnivores and, thus, should not be skimped on. Our favorite toppings for a supreme pizza include pepperoni, sausage, olives, mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, and onions.
